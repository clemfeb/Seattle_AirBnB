# Seattle_AirBnB
Project 1 - SeattleAirBnB

Never having visited Seattle, and never having used AirBNB; I thought it might be useful to have a look at the data avialable to see if it could help me plan a trip to Seattle. I decided to use the AirBNB data for the Seattle area to determine:

What makes Seattle interesting, based on the AirBNB user reviews collected? Where are the top 10 AirBNB locations situated in Seattle? which locations are the best value for money (based on ratings and price) Who are the best hosts in the top 10 locations?

Attached is the full python code developed to answer these simple questions, based on the AirBNB data provided as part of the Udacity course

Files included there is one .py file which contains all the code. I used a folium map to make the report a bit mor interactive, the library was installed into my Jupyter notebook environment (https://pypi.org/project/folium/0.1.5/) I also used a worcloud plugin to generate the wordcloud image. I used this tutorial (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python) as a guide
